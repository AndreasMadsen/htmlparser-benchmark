# htmlparser-benchmark

> Simple benchmark for different htmlparsers using real-life data

## What is this good for?

Don't use a particular parser just because it shows good results in this benchmark.
Instead, this benchmark is best for comparing changes between individual versions of parsers,
as well as for parser authors to see how much room for improvement there is.

Even though all libraries included in this benchmark parse something HTML-like, most don't fully follow
the HTML spec. As of August 2021, [`parse5`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/parse5) is the only
fully spec compliant HTML parser available for NodeJS. If you are okay with slightly different results,
have a look at the libraries benchmarked here and pick the one with the ideal trade-offs for your scenario.

## Installation

```shell
npm install htmlparser-benchmark
```

## How to run

#### Use as a module

```javascript
const Benchmark = require('htmlparser-benchmark');
const { Parser } = require('htmlparser2');

const bench = new Benchmark((html, callback) => {
	const parser = new Parser({
		onend: callback,
		onerror: callback,
	});
	parser.end(html);
});

bench.on('progress', (key) => {
	console.log(`finished parsing ${key}.html`);
});

bench.on('result', (stat) => {
	console.log(
		`${stat.mean().toPrecision(6)} ms/file Â± ${stat.sd().toPrecision(6)}`,
	);
});
```

Where `stat` is a [Summary](https://github.com/AndreasMadsen/summary) object.

#### Use the script

You can also just run `npm test`, that will benchmark all the modules listed
in the `wrapper` directory. Note that you will need to install the `dev-dependencies`
first.

```shell
cd htmlparser-benchmark
npm install
npm test
```
