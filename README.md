#htmlparser-benchmark

> Simple benchmark for diffrent htmlparsers using real-life data

## Installation

```shell
npm install htmlparser-benchmark
```

## How to run

#### Use as a module

```javascript
var benchmark = require('htmlparser-benchmark');
var Parser = require("htmlparser2").Parser;

var bench = benchmark(function (html, callback) {
	var parser = new Parser({
		onend: callback,
		onerror: callback
	});
	parser.end(html);
});

bench.on('progress', function (key) {
	console.log('finished parsing ' + key + '.html');
});

bench.on('result', function (stat) {
	console.log(stat.mean().toPrecision(6) + ' ms/file Â± ' + stat.sd().toPrecision(6));
});
```

Where `stat` is a [Summary](https://github.com/AndreasMadsen/summary) object.

#### Use the script

You can also just run `npm test`, that will benchmark all the modules listed
in the `wrapper` directory. Note that you will need to install the `dev-dependencies`
first.

```shell
cd htmlparser-benchmark
npm install
npm test
```
